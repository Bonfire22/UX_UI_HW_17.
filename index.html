        <h1> Hi, I'm Bonnie Gregory </h1>
        <p>
            I am a multidisciplinary Designer that creates enchanting digital and physical experiences. My main focus is on XD but I also have great UX/UI skills and I'm fascinated by accessibility. 

   My work can be seen at Denver International Airport, The Museum of Contemporary Art Denver, and the Department of Architecture at The University of Colorado to name a few.  I have had work featured in Modern in Denver Magazine and have had the pleasure of being a panelist for TED Talks.

   I am continually learning! I just completed a course through the University of Denver on UX/UI and Design Thinking to be better equipped at creating unique experiences for my clients.

   Currently living in Denver with my lovely rabbit.
